# MealsToGo Application

## Source code
Found in directory ./src

## Application metadata
Found in ./app.json

## Running locally
when we start building locally we can only run our app on our phone when we are running expo locally.

If you turn off expo you won't be able to see your app unless you start expo again.

You have a "local" build that will run while your development environment is running.

## Publishing your app
"publishing" your app to expo which will allow you to access the version of your app that you publish without having the run the local environment. If you're interested in doing this throughout the course rather then at the end check out our video on Expo Publish or read the [docs](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/classic-updates/publishing/)

## Publishing your app to the App Store or Google Play Store
Note here that "publishing your app to expo" is NOT the same as publishing your app to the app store.

## Debugging
In Expo Go client shake your device to pull up the menu.
